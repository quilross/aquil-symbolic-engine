## Secret Hygiene & API Tokens

- **Never export or echo API tokens in your shell history.**
- **Never commit secrets to source control.**
- Use `wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to securely set your Cloudflare API token for local/dev/prod.
- Store secrets in `.env` files (see `.env.example` for format), but always keep `.env` files out of git.
- Code should always read secrets from environment variables or Wrangler secrets, never from hardcoded source.

## Logging Design

Aquil uses unified logging across D1 (SQLite), KV, R2, and Vectorize. All logs are written via `/api/log` and can be retrieved via `/api/logs`. Health of all bindings is checked via `/api/health`.

- **/api/log**: POST endpoint to write logs. Accepts `{ type, payload, session_id, who, level, tags, binary, textOrVector }`.
- **/api/logs**: GET endpoint to retrieve logs from D1, KV, R2, and Vector. Returns `{ d1, kv, r2, vector }`.
- **/api/health**: GET endpoint to check health of D1, KV, R2, AI, and Vector bindings. Returns `{ ok, d1, kv, r2, ai, vector }`.

### Secret Management

- Use `wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to securely set your Cloudflare API token for local/dev/prod.
- Store secrets in `.env` files (see `.env.example` for format), but always keep `.env` files out of git.
- Code should always read secrets from environment variables or Wrangler secrets, never from hardcoded source.
- `.gitignore` ensures `.env` and all secret files are excluded from git.

### .env.example

```
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token-here
```

### .gitignore

```
.env
.env.*
```

See `scripts/test-logging.mjs` for integration tests of logging endpoints.

## Integration Testing (Miniflare/Codespaces)

To run local integration tests for unified logging endpoints:

1. Start your Cloudflare Worker locally:

   ```bash
   wrangler dev
   ```

   This will start the API at http://127.0.0.1:8787

2. In a separate terminal, run the integration test script:

   ```bash
   node scripts/test-logging.mjs
   ```

   This will POST a log and GET logs, asserting D1 and KV results.

If the test passes, you will see 'Integration test passed.' in the output.
