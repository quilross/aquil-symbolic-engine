# Not Needed Files - For Review

This folder contains files that appear to be no longer needed for the core operation of the Aquil Symbolic Engine. These files have been moved here for review before deletion.

## Files moved and their reasons:

### Historical/Report Files
- **AUDIT_REPORT.md** - Historical audit report from development phase (outdated)
- **.openhands/** - Task completion tracking files (completed work)

### One-time Setup Files  
- **setup.js** - One-time infrastructure setup script (no longer needed after deployment)
- **validate-deployment.js** - Deployment validation script (useful for deployment but not ongoing operations)

### Documentation That May Cause Confusion
- **CHATGPT_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - External ChatGPT custom GPT setup guide (not core to engine functionality)
- **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Deployment process documentation (useful for deployment but may clutter ongoing development)
- **ARK_RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Detailed implementation documentation (very technical, may confuse GPT usage)
- **AUTONOMOUS_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Detailed implementation documentation (very technical, may confuse GPT usage)

## Review Process
1. Review each file to confirm it's not needed for core functionality
2. Test that the main system still works without these files
3. Delete files that are confirmed as no longer needed
4. Move back any files that are actually required

## Safety Note
All core functionality should remain intact. The main tests (test-logging.js, test-ark-integration.js, etc.) should still pass after moving files here.
