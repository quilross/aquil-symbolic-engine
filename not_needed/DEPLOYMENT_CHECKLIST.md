|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Autonomous Logic | 96.6% | 56/58 tests passed |
| Error Handling | 100% | 26/26 tests passed |
| Performance | 100% | All metrics within targets |
| Logging | 78.6% | 11/14 tests passed |
| Integration | 100% | 8/8 tests passed |
| **Overall** | **95.0%** | **119/125 tests passed** |

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Autonomous Trigger System
- **122 keywords** across 11 categories
- **Confidence scoring** for trigger accuracy
- **Multi-trigger detection** in single messages
- **Context-aware responses** based on user state

### Logging & Traceability
- **Session-based tracking** for complete user journeys
- **Autonomous action logging** to D1 and KV stores
- **Error logging** with fallback mechanisms
- **Debug endpoints** for system monitoring

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database indexes** for fast query performance
- **Concurrent request handling** up to 3,677 req/sec
- **Memory efficient** with minimal overhead
- **Error recovery** mechanisms

### Scheduled Automation
- **Daily wisdom** synthesis at 7 AM and 7 PM

## 🔍 Production Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /api/debug/health` - System status
- `GET /api/debug/logs` - Recent activity
- `GET /api/autonomous/stats` - Usage statistics

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Trigger Detection Rate** - Should be >95%
2. **Response Time** - Should be <100ms average
3. **Error Rate** - Should be <1%
4. **Memory Usage** - Should be stable
5. **Database Performance** - Query times <50ms

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Log Filtering** - Some advanced filtering tests failed (acceptable for v1)
2. **Keyword Overlap** - Some triggers may overlap (e.g., financial stress vs general stress)
3. **Context Sensitivity** - System doesn't yet understand deep context nuances

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy

# Run database migrations
wrangler d1 execute AQUIL_DB --file=schema.sql

# Test deployment
curl https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/debug/health
```
